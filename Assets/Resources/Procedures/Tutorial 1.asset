  description: "Hey there!  That test stream went great yesterday, well done!  But
    today's the real deal, so let's kick it off strong.  \n\n    Let's test a wide
    variety of dosage amounts to find out what works best for future experiments.
    \ Take 4 slugs and give them dosages of Testosterone incrementing by 1.  \n\n
    \   This should help us figure out the dosage usage for future experiments, and
    be our most exciting stream yet!"
