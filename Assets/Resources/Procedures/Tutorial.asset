  description: "Good Morning, and welcome to your new job as a D4S Researcher! \n\n
    \   As you know, D4S streams all results of drug testing for posterity and fun.
    \ But don't worry, today's experiment is simply to get you adjusted to your workspace,
    and our livestreaming equipment.  All you need to do is test the effects of a
    single dose of pepper on a single slug and run a test stream showing the results.
    \n\n    Make sure to add a slug to the control group before proceeding!"
