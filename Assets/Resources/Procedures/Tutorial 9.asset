    \   Speaking of which, superiors want a replacement slug and don't want any more
    testosterone or katfeine in today's experiment.  Apparently they're \"too much
    of drugs\" for the day after an accident.\n\n    I don't know how we're supposed
    to get things done around here, but good luck either way."
