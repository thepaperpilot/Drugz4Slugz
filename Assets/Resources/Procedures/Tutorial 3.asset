  description: "While it's not my place to question your workplace decor, some of
    our viewers have noticed and responded positively to your animu thing on the shelf.\n\n
    \   I don't quite get it, but we don't have any drug tests planned for today,
    so instead of sitting around, why not run a stream with the slugs and that stuff?\n\n
    \   It's a work day and a weird hour, I doubt the reception will be all that positive,
    but everything is worth a try when it comes to science!"
